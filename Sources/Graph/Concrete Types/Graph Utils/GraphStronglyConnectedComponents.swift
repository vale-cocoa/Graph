/// A utility to query a graph for its (strongly) connected components.

/// Since a graph can contain a huge number of vertices and edges, this utility is a stand-alone class type which
/// gets initialized with the graph to query.
/// Results for queries are calculated lazily the first time a query is made.
/// Note that results are valid for the graph state used at initialization time, thus a new instance of this utility
/// must be created to query a mutated graph.
/// - Note: For graphs of kind `.undirected` this utility builds connected components
///         adopting the depth first search traversal of the graph on every vertex.
///         On the other hand, for graphs of kind `.directed`, **strongly connected components**
///         are built by adopting the *Kosaraju-Sharir* algorithm.
