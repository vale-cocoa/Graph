/// A utility to query a weighted graph for the shortest paths from a source vertex to other vertices.
///
/// Since a graph can contain a huge number of vertices and edges and the algorithm for finding shortest paths leverages on
/// DAGs, this utility is a stand-alone class type which gets initialized directly from the GraphCycle utility.
/// Results for queries are calculated lazily the first time a query is made.
/// Note that results are valid for the graph state used at initialization time, thus a new instance must be
/// created to query a mutated graph instance.
/// - Note: This utility adopts an algorithm leveraging on the topological sort of a directed graph;
///         therefore complexity of first query should be in the magnitude of O(?).
/// - Important:    `GraphAcyclicSP` new instances can only be instanciated and obtained
///                 by querying a `GraphCycle` utility instance via its `shortestsPaths(from:)`
///                 method. Such instance method only returns a valid `GraphAcyclicSP` instance
///                 if its queried graph is an edge weighted directed acyclic graph.
