/// Since a graph can contain a huge number of vertices and edges, this utility is a stand-alone class type which
/// gets initialized with the weighted graph to query and the source vertex.
/// Results for queries are calculated lazily the first time a query is made.
/// Note that results are valid for the graph state used at initialization time, thus a new instance must be
/// created to query a mutated graph instance
/// - Note: This utility adopts the Bellman-Ford algorithm; implementation is queue based,
///         therefore overall complexity will be most likely O(*E* + *V*) for the first query.
