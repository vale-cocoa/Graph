/// Note that results are valid for the graph state used at initialization time, thus a new instance must be
/// created to query a mutated graph instance
/// - Note: This utility adopts the Dijkstra algorithm, therefore overall complexity will be
///          O(?) for the first query, and **edges weight values must not be negative.**
///         That is Dijkstra algorithm not get correctly shortests paths in presence of negative weight values
///         or worst get into an infinite loop if the graph contains a negative cycle.
