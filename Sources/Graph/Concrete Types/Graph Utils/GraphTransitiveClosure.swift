/// A utility to query a graph for its transitive closure.
///
/// Since a graph can contain a huge number of vertices and edges, this utility is a stand-alone class type which
/// gets initialized with the graph to query.
/// Results for queries are calculated lazily the first time a query is made.
/// Note that results are valid for the graph state used at initialization time, thus a new instance of this utility
/// must be created to query a mutated graph.
/// - Note: Transitive closure is a term meant to be related to directed graphs,
///         this utility though queries graphs with both type of vertex connetions, directed and undirected,
///         stressing the main functionality of finding reachability between two vertices in the queried graph.
