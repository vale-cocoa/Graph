// Operator for "undirected comparison" of two edges.

    /// an **undirected edge**. In order to do that, it doesn't strongly declares the two vertices connected,
    /// but rather uses this method to obtain the vertex connected to the one given as parameter.
    /// It is always possible to obtain the two vertices connected by and edge instance conforming to
    /// `GraphEdge` by doing:
    ///
    /// ```Swift
    /// // assuming `e` is an instance of type `E`
    /// // where `E: GraphEdge`:
    /// let vertex = e.either
    /// let neighbour = e.other(vertex)
    /// ```

    /// - Returns: The other vertex in the edge, connected to the given one.
    /// - Complexity: O(1).
    /// - Warning: Conforming types's behavior of this method for vertices connected by an  instance,
    ///         is expected to be as the one in the following example:
    ///
    /// ```Swift
    /// // assuming `e` is an instance of type `E`
    /// // where `E: GraphEdge`:
    /// let v = e.either
    /// let w = e.other(v)
    /// let u = e.other(w)
    /// u == v // must be true
    /// ```
    ///
    /// When given as `vertex` parameter a value neither equal to `either` value nor the one retunred by
    /// `other(either)`, then conforming types are expected to fail with a runtime error:
    ///
    /// ```Swift
    /// // assuming `e` is an instance of type `E`
    /// // where `E: GraphEdge`,
    /// // `v` == e.ither, `w` == e.other(e.either);
    /// // assuming also `u` is another vertex where
    /// // `u` != `v` and `u` != `w`
    /// // then doing:
    /// let y = e.other(u) // NOT PERMITTED, Runtime error.
    /// ```
    ///
