    /// in order to obtain the inversion of a **direct graph**.
    /// Conversely, graphs whose `kind` property value is `.undirected` have their inverted graph
    /// corresponding to the same graph since their vertices' connections are bi-directional.
    /// In the following example is shown the beahvior of this method on a **direct graph**:
